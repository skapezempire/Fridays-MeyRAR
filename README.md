This is an AR project; Augmenting Fridays restaurant
## Inspiration
Fridays restaurant used to be a popular restaurant in Ghana many years ago.
After a while, though people still frequented the place, it can't be compared to the hype of those days which partly I think either most folks have moved from the estate, are grown up now, or have alternative restaurants.
So, I decided to do something with AR to just make it a lively place again.

## What it does
This project has various experiences at various entrances of Fridays' restaurants. This is so that every person experiences different experiences hence, allowing for people to move around the restaurant from conversations they hear from others, so as to have such experiences.
The assets range from dancing life-size gifs and a few animated 3D assets to make the experience a better one.
Some of the gifs are activated with music upon reaching 30cm of a gif. Examples, are the dancing neon brick dancing figures.

## How we built it
I used the geospatial creator feature in Adobe Aero to map out the Location(Fridays restaurant) then I had to use the scene and trigger properties of each asset ( downloaded gifs, 3D models, and sound) to add motion / make them interactive/lively.

## Challenges we ran into
I think Adobe Aero and the geospatial features are a great technology to have but in my county, Ghana, geospatial loads the map as flat, compared to that of European countries, which appears in 3D form when I used European coordinates. Making it difficult for me to actually resize assets to the desired scale to suit the experience.
Also, since Adobe Aero supports higher-end devices, it makes testing my creations difficult since I always have to rely on friends with supported devices to come over to test my work which they aren't readily available.
Furthermore, the choice of assets and how to make each of them match the desired outcome was very challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud to have been able to compose an immersive experience using different assets.

## What we learned
I learned that the future is exciting, looking at the technologies readily available to us.

## What's next for Fridays Restaurant-MeyRAR
I guess, I need to work with the restaurant to make tailored immersive solutions for them.
